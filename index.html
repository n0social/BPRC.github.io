        <p align="center"> Here are some widely known Facts about High Blood Pressure among Adults.</p>
        <ul align="center">
            <ul>- Having hypertension puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the United States.</ul>
            <ul>- In 2018, nearly half a million deaths in the United States included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause.</ul>
            <ul>- Only about 1 in 4 adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control.3</ul>
            <ul>- High blood pressure costs the United States about $131 billion each year, averaged over 12 years from 2003 to 2014.</ul>

        <p>In order to raise awareness of High Blood Pressure and the damage it can cause on our bodies. I decided to develop
            a coin dedicated to High Blood Pressure. Blood Pressure Coin (BPRC) was made to bring awareness to the health disease 
            that has been sweeping the nation for years. This not-for-profit-coin has been made under the Ethereum Test Network. This is one of
            my many projects. This is actually the first coin I have developed (trust me, it was super easy). With this made, I can say that I have completed
            my first test run, and am ready to get started on the real deal! If you want to support the test-coin, and would like to be a hodler, email me @bprccoin@gmail.com (I'm not really going to pay attention to the emails. It's a test website.), and I will send you as many coins as you like (max:50,000). These coins cost nothing since they are on
            the test network, but if this site gains traction and awareness, I will upload the coin (and will pay the gas fees) to post it
            onto the main network. 
        </p>
